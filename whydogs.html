            <h4>Unconditional love. Devoted companionship. Constant entertainment. Most of us dog lovers know that life is better with a dog. But is that knowledge based on a feeling—or is there something else at work? There is: Science.</h6>
            <h4>Spending time with canine companions does wonders for your wellbeing. Recent research shows that owning a dog is good for you physically and emotionally.

            <span><h3 class="color">1. Dogs increase your mood dramatically! </h3>
            <img class="images" style="width:126px ;height:107px ;" src="images/pug.jpg" alt=""><h6>Spending just 15-30 minutes with your dog can help you feel more calm and relaxed, reducing stress and increasing happiness. Playing with your pup increases your brain’s levels of dopamine and serotonin, both of which are neurotransmitters associated with pleasure and tranquility. So the next time you’re feeling down, grab a toy and spend some time with your pup! That wagging tail will be sure to put a smile on your face.</h6>

            <div class="row hov">
            <span><h3 class="color">2. Humans with dogs recover more quickly from illnesses.</h3>
            <img class="images" style="width: 126px;height:170px;" src="images/do2.jpg" alt=""><h6>Dog owners have a much higher rate of recovery from being sick than non-dog owners. In fact, humans with pooches who suffer from heart attacks are twice as likely to fully recover as those without! So start cuddling your dog!</h6>
            </span><hr></div>
            <div class="row hov">
            <span><h3 class="color" >3. Having a dog improves your physical well-being and encourages a healthy fitness.</h3>
            <img class=images style="width:126px;height: 89px;" src="images/do3.jpg" alt=""><h6>Of course! Your dog requires daily exercise, and so do you! Dog owners carry the responsibility of playing with and working their dogs, so it only makes sense that dog people tend to be more active.</h6>

            <div class="row hov">
            <span><h3 class="color">4. Dogs help increase social interactions.</h3>
            <img class="images" style="width:144px ;height:122px ;" src="images/do4.jpg" alt=""><h6>Not only do dogs need care and playtime with their humans, but they need time to socialise with other pups too! This means that their humans will have a chance to socialise while they oversee the puppy playdates. Even going on a walk in the neighborhood can bring many new friends around and start many conversations!</h6>
            </span><hr></div>
            <div class="row hov">
            <span><h3 class="color">5. Having a dog makes YOU more awesome!</h3>
            <img class="images" style="width:143px ;height:98px ;" src="images/do5.jpg" alt=""><h6>The responsibility, patience, selflessness, and commitment that come with having a dog make us stronger, all-around better people.</h6>

            <div class="row hov">
            <span><h3 class="color">6. Owning a dog could make you more attractive to potential love matches.</h3>
            <img class="images" style="width:160px ;height:171px ;" src="images/do6.jpg" alt=""><h6>According to a study conducted by Dog’s Trust, out of 700 surveyed people, 60 percent said that owning a dog can make others more attractive, while 85 percent think people are more approachable when they are with a dog.</h6>
            </span><hr></div>

            <span><h3 class="color">7. Because they live to protect their little mates!</h3>
            <img class="images" style="width:159px ;height:114px ;" src="images/do7.jpg" alt=""><h6>And children can learn a lot of their fur friends! Remembering to feed, provide water, and clean up after a dog can give children a sense of importance and satisfaction.</h6>
            <h6>Dogs also teach children about socialisation. Like most of us, dogs are social animals who enjoy and need attention and affection.  By learning how to interact with a dog, children can learn how to better socialise with new faces and other children.</h6>
            </span><hr></div>
            <div class="row hov">
            <span><h3 class="color">8. They are a reflection of your personality!</h3>

A study in England found a very clear correlation between people’s personalities and what type of dogs they owned. For example, people who owned toy dogs tended to be more intelligent, while owners of utility dogs like Dalmatians and bulldogs were the most conscientious. But be careful: Dogs also take on their owners’ personality traits, so if you fly off the handle all the time, your pooch may wind up with aggressive tendencies.</h6>
